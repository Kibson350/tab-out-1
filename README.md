Tab Out replaces your Chrome new tab page with a dashboard that shows everything you have open — grouped by domain, with landing pages (Gmail, X, LinkedIn, etc.) pulled into their own group for easy cleanup. Close tabs with a satisfying swoosh + confetti.

Built for people who open too many tabs and never close them.

---

## ✨ Features

- **See all your tabs at a glance** — grouped by domain on a clean grid, no more squinting at 30 tiny tab titles
- **Landing pages group** — homepages and feeds (Gmail, X, LinkedIn, GitHub, YouTube) are pulled into one card so you can close them all at once
- **Close tabs with style** — swoosh sound + confetti burst when you clean up a group. Makes tab hygiene feel rewarding
- **Duplicate detection** — flags when you have the same page open twice, with one-click cleanup
- **Click any tab to jump to it** — switches to the existing tab, even across windows
- **Save for later** — bookmark individual tabs to a checklist before closing them
- **Dark mode** — sun/moon toggle with a full dark palette, persists across sessions
- **Google search** — search bar built into the dashboard so you never need to open a blank tab
- **Daily quote** — rotating motivational quote below the search bar to start each day right
- **Weather widget** — current temperature and conditions in the header, no API key needed
- **Pomodoro timer** — 25/5 work-break timer in the header, survives tab closes
- **Recently closed tabs** — collapsible list of tabs you just closed, one click to reopen
- **Drag-to-reorder quick links** — rearrange your shortcut icons with drag and drop, order persists
- **Expandable groups** — large groups show the first 8 tabs with a clickable "+N more" to reveal the rest
- **Auto-updates** — get notified when a new version is available, update with one click
- **100% local** — your browsing data never leaves your machine. No AI, no external API calls
- **Always on** — starts automatically when you log in, runs silently in the background

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install with a coding agent

Send your coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) this repo and say **"install this"**:

```
https://github.com/markksantos/tab-out
```

The agent will explain what Tab Out does and set everything up. Takes about 2 minutes.

### Manual setup

**1. Clone and install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markksantos/tab-out.git
cd tab-out
npm install
```

**2. Run the setup script**

```bash
npm run install-service
```

This creates `~/.mission-control/`, writes a default config, and installs an auto-start service for your platform (macOS Launch Agent, Linux systemd, or Windows Startup script).

**3. Load the Chrome extension**

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension/` folder from this repo

**4. Start the server**

```bash
npm start
```

Open a new tab — you'll see Tab Out. The server auto-starts on future logins.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Config lives at `~/.mission-control/config.json`:

| Field | Default | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | `3456` | Local port for the dashboard |

---

## 🔧 How it works

```
You open a new tab
  -> Chrome extension loads Tab Out in an iframe
  -> Dashboard shows your open tabs grouped by domain
  -> Landing pages (Gmail, X, LinkedIn, etc.) get their own group at the top
  -> You close groups you're done with (swoosh + confetti)
  -> Repeat
```

The server runs silently in the background. It starts on login and restarts if it crashes. You never think about it.
